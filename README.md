Deep Learning Project

Date : Fri 02.August.2019
Time : 6-9

Project Structure:

DATASET EXPLINATION:

First of all i've take a library called beautifulsoup.

Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.

after that, take some genre which show top movies according to imbd rating.

connect the imbd links with genre.

ALGORITHM:

Select scrapping algorithm which shows the list by the emotions.




# PROJECT INTRODUCTION/ Objective


A recommender system is a simple algorithm whose aim is to provide the most relevant information to a user by discovering patterns in a dataset. The algorithm rates the items and shows the user the items that they would rate highly. An example of recommendation in action is when you visit Amazon and you notice that some items are being recommended to you or when Netflix recommends certain movies to you. They are also used by Music streaming applications such as Spotify and Deezer to recommend music that you might like.


# Conclusion

easy to find out the top movies according to genre.
